This is a simple python script to check for existing vulnerable HTTP Methods, as well as check SSL and display in a logical way what is insecure and what is secure.

It is intended to work on all operating systems although I have only tested it on windows and Ubuntu. It uses SSLyze which uses openssl on linux.

To use this just run scan.py and enter the hostname of the server that you are testing. It will handle the rest.
